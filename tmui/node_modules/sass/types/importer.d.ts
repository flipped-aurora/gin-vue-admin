 *
 * This is the process of resolving a load using a custom importer:

 * - It calls {@link canonicalize} with `"db:foo/bar/baz"`.
 * - {@link canonicalize} returns `new URL("db:foo/bar/baz/_index.scss")`.
 * - If the compiler has already loaded a stylesheet with this canonical URL, it
 *   re-uses the existing module.
 * - Otherwise, it calls {@link load} with `new
 *   URL("db:foo/bar/baz/_index.scss")`.
 * - {@link load} returns an {@link ImporterResult} that the compiler uses as
 *   the contents of the module.
 *
 * See {@link Options.importers} for more details on the way loads are resolved
 * using multiple importers and load paths.
 *
 * @typeParam sync - An `Importer<'sync'>`'s {@link canonicalize} and {@link

 *
 * An `Importer<'async'>`'s {@link canonicalize} and {@link load} may either
 * return synchronously or asynchronously, but it can only be used with {@link
 * compileAsync} and {@link compileStringAsync}.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```js
 * sass.compile('style.scss', {
 *   // An importer for URLs like `bgcolor:orange` that generates a
 *   // stylesheet with the given background color.
 *   importers: [{
 *     canonicalize(url) {

  /**
   * If `url` is recognized by this importer, returns its canonical format.
   *
   * If Sass has already loaded a stylesheet with the returned canonical URL, it
   * re-uses the existing parse tree (and the loaded module for `@use`). This
   * means that importers **must ensure** that the same canonical URL always
   * refers to the same stylesheet, *even across different importers*. As such,
   * importers are encouraged to use unique URL schemes to disambiguate between
   * one another.
   *
   * As much as possible, custom importers should canonicalize URLs the same way
   * as the built-in filesystem importer:
   *
   * - The importer should look for stylesheets by adding the prefix `_` to the
   *   URL's basename, and by adding the extensions `.sass` and `.scss` if the
   *   URL doesn't already have one of those extensions. For example, if the
   *   URL was `foo/bar/baz`, the importer would look for:
   *   - `foo/bar/baz.sass`
   *   - `foo/bar/baz.scss`
   *   - `foo/bar/_baz.sass`
   *   - `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
   *
   *   If the URL was `foo/bar/baz.scss`, the importer would just look for:
   *   - `foo/bar/baz.scss`
   *   - `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
   *
   *   If the importer finds a stylesheet at more than one of these URLs, it
   *   should throw an exception indicating that the URL is ambiguous. Note that
   *   if the extension is explicitly specified, a stylesheet with the opposite
   *   extension is allowed to exist.
   *
   * - If none of the possible paths is valid, the importer should perform the
   *   same resolution on the URL followed by `/index`. In the example above,
   *   it would look for:
   *   - `foo/bar/baz/index.sass`
   *   - `foo/bar/baz/index.scss`
   *   - `foo/bar/baz/_index.sass`
   *   - `foo/bar/baz/_index.scss`
   *
   *   As above, if the importer finds a stylesheet at more than one of these
   *   URLs, it should throw an exception indicating that the import is
   *   ambiguous.
   *
   * If no stylesheets are found, the importer should return `null`.
   *
   * Calling {@link canonicalize} multiple times with the same URL must return
   * the same result. Calling {@link canonicalize} with a URL returned by a
   * previous call to {@link canonicalize} must return that URL.
   *
   * Relative loads in stylesheets loaded from an importer are handled by
   * resolving the loaded URL relative to the canonical URL of the stylesheet
   * that contains it, and passing that URL back to the importer's {@link
   * canonicalize} method. For example, suppose the "Resolving a Load" example
   * {@link Importer | above} returned a stylesheet that contained `@use
   * "mixins"`:
   *
   * - The compiler resolves the URL `mixins` relative to the current
   *   stylesheet's canonical URL `db:foo/bar/baz/_index.scss` to get
   *   `db:foo/bar/baz/mixins`.
   * - It calls {@link canonicalize} with `"db:foo/bar/baz/mixins"`.
   * - {@link canonicalize} returns `new URL("db:foo/bar/baz/_mixins.scss")`.
   *
   * Because of this, {@link canonicalize} must return a meaningful result when
   * called with a URL relative to one returned by an earlier call to {@link
   * canonicalize}.
   *
   * @param url - The loaded URL. Since this might be relative, it's represented
   * as a string rather than a {@link URL} object.
   *
   * @returns An absolute URL if this importer recognizes the `url`, or `null`
   * if it doesn't. If this returns `null`, other importers or {@link
   * Options.loadPaths | load paths} may handle the load.
   *
   * This may also return a `Promise`, but if it does the importer may only be
   * passed to {@link compileAsync} and {@link compileStringAsync}, not {@link
   * compile} or {@link compileString}.
   *
   * @throws any - If this importer recognizes `url` but determines that it's

/**
 * The built-in Node.js package importer. This loads pkg: URLs from node_modules
 * according to the standard Node.js resolution algorithm.
 *
 * A Node.js package importer is exposed as a class that can be added to the
 * `importers` option.
 *
 *```js
 * const sass = require('sass');
 * sass.compileString('@use "pkg:vuetify', {
 *   importers: [new sass.NodePackageImporter()]
 * });
 *```
 *
 * ## Writing Sass packages
 *
 * Package authors can control what is exposed to their users through their
 * `package.json` manifest. The recommended method is to add a `sass`
 * conditional export to `package.json`.
 *
 * ```json
 * // node_modules/uicomponents/package.json
 * {
 *   "exports": {
 *     ".": {
 *       "sass": "./src/scss/index.scss",
 *       "import": "./dist/js/index.mjs",
 *       "default": "./dist/js/index.js"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This allows a package user to write `@use "pkg:uicomponents"` to load the
 * file at `node_modules/uicomponents/src/scss/index.scss`.
 *
 * The Node.js package importer supports the variety of formats supported by
 * Node.js [package entry points], allowing authors to expose multiple subpaths.
 *
 * [package entry points]:
 * https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points
 *
 * ```json
 * // node_modules/uicomponents/package.json
 * {
 *   "exports": {
 *     ".": {
 *       "sass": "./src/scss/index.scss",
 *     },
 *     "./colors.scss": {
 *       "sass": "./src/scss/_colors.scss",
 *     },
 *     "./theme/*.scss": {
 *       "sass": "./src/scss/theme/*.scss",
 *     },
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This allows a package user to write:
 *
 * - `@use "pkg:uicomponents";` to import the root export.
 * - `@use "pkg:uicomponents/colors";` to import the colors partial.
 * - `@use "pkg:uicomponents/theme/purple";` to import a purple theme.
 *
 * Note that while library users can rely on the importer to resolve
 * [partials](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#partials), [index
 * files](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#index-files), and
 * extensions, library authors must specify the entire file path in `exports`.
 *
 * In addition to the `sass` condition, the `style` condition is also
 * acceptable. Sass will match the `default` condition if it's a relevant file
 * type, but authors are discouraged from relying on this. Notably, the key
 * order matters, and the importer will resolve to the first value with a key
 * that is `sass`, `style`, or `default`, so you should always put `default`
 * last.
 *
 * To help package authors who haven't transitioned to package entry points
 * using the `exports` field, the Node.js package importer provides several
 * fallback options. If the `pkg:` URL does not have a subpath, the Node.js
 * package importer will look for a `sass` or `style` key at the root of
 * `package.json`.
 *
 * ```json
 * // node_modules/uicomponents/package.json
 * {
 *   "sass": "./src/scss/index.scss",
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This allows a user to write `@use "pkg:uicomponents";` to import the
 * `index.scss` file.
 *
 * Finally, the Node.js package importer will look for an `index` file at the
 * package root, resolving partials and extensions. For example, if the file
 * `_index.scss` exists in the package root of `uicomponents`, a user can import
 * that with `@use "pkg:uicomponents";`.
 *
 * If a `pkg:` URL includes a subpath that doesn't have a match in package entry
 * points, the Node.js importer will attempt to find that file relative to the
 * package root, resolving for file extensions, partials and index files. For
 * example, if the file `src/sass/_colors.scss` exists in the `uicomponents`
 * package, a user can import that file using `@use
 * "pkg:uicomponents/src/sass/colors";`.
