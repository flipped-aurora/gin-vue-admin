# vue-inbrowser-compiler-independent-utils

Part of the [vue-inbrowser-compiler-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-inbrowser-compiler-utils) package that do not depend on vue.

The reason this package was created was to be able to share function between `vue-docgen-api` and `vue-inbrowser-compiler` without needing to enable postinstall scripts for `vue-docgen-api`. See [#1373](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist/issues/1373)

## install

```bash
yarn add vue-inbrowser-compiler-independent-utils
```
