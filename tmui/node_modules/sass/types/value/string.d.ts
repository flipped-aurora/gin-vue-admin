   *
   * In addition, Sass indices refer to Unicode code points while JavaScript
   * string indices refer to UTF-16 code units. For example, the character
   * U+1F60A SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES is a single Unicode code point but
   * is represented in UTF-16 as two code units (`0xD83D` and `0xDE0A`). So in
   * JavaScript, `"nðŸ˜Šb".charCodeAt(1)` returns `0xD83D`, whereas in Sass
   * `string.slice("nðŸ˜Šb", 1, 1)` returns `"ðŸ˜Š"`.
   *
   * This function converts Sass's code point indices to JavaScript's code unit
   * indices. This means it's O(n) in the length of `text`.
